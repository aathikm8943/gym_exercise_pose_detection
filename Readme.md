## Project Overview

A robust pose-aware exercise movement analysis system that:

* Extracts and preprocesses video frames.
* Classifies gym exercises such as **Bicep Curl** and **Lateral Raise**.
* Applies **custom rule-based checks** (e.g., joint angles) on pose data to validate **correct form**.
* Displays **real-time feedback** via a Streamlit app.

---

## Objectives

* Detect exercise type and verify if performed **with correct form**.
* Highlight real-time feedback using **joint-based rules** (e.g., elbow angle must be > 90°).
* Support modular expansion for additional exercises and rules.
* Offer an intuitive web interface to **display rep count, rule violations, and live accuracy**.

## Setup & How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed, then:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 2. Launch Streamlit Live App

Run the web interface:

```bash
streamlit run src/app/streamlit_app.py
```

Features:

* Real-time pose detection
* Rule validation feedback
* Rep count
* Accuracy progress bar

---

## Sample Output

Output video: [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19miin2IzUx6KrV4sDLU38nECgYaB6rE-?usp=sharing)

Real-time app feedback:

* Reps counted successfully when rules are satisfied
* Warnings shown for broken posture (e.g., wrong elbow angle)
* Pass ratio bar with live accuracy
* Uploaded video displayed frame-by-frame

---

## Notes

* Pose detection uses **MediaPipe**.
* Frame validation rules are **editable via `config/rules_description.yaml`**.
* Extend support to other exercises by:
* Works on CPU, but GPU strongly recommended for smooth pose estimation.
